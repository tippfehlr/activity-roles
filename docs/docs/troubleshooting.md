#### The bot isn’t working, what can I do?

- you can look to see if the bot is in a role higher than the role you are trying to give
- if the role was given to someone manually, the bot will not work
- if your problem isn’t solved, head to the [support discord server](https://discord.gg/UvpVgX9M5j)

#### Can the bot remove a role after someone stops playing a game?

Yes! Just set `<permanent>` to false and you should be good to go!
