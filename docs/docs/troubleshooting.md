#### The bot isn't working, what can i do?

- you can look to see if the bot is in a role higher than the role you are trying to give
- if the role was given to someone manually, the bot will not work
- if any of that worked for you, head to the [support discord server](https://discord.gg/UvpVgX9M5j)

#### Can the bot take a role after someone stop playing it?

Yes! Just set `<permanent>` to false and you should be good to go!
